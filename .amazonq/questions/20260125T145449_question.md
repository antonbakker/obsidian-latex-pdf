# Question Summary

- Context: AWS-related infrastructure for this project, specifically Elastic IP (EIP) usage.
- Actual question: Check where Elastic IPs are defined/used in this project and whether all currently defined/allocated IP addresses are actually needed.
- Relation to previous questions: This appears to be the first question in the current session, so no previous context applies.
- Unclear / needs attention: 
  - Which AWS account(s) and region(s) are in scope.
  - Whether all infrastructure is defined as code in this repo or partly managed manually via AWS console.
- Plan to improve results:
  - Scan the codebase for any Elastic IP definitions/usages (CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform, raw CloudFormation templates, or scripts).
  - Summarise which EIPs are defined, how many there are, and what each is attached to.
  - Identify any EIPs that appear unused or duplicative and outline how to verify usage in AWS.

# Outcome / Results

- Status: INITIAL ANALYSIS STARTED. Codebase scan pending.
- Done so far: Created this summary file and planned the analysis steps.
- Remaining: Run code search for Elastic IP usage and interpret whether multiple EIPs are necessary.

## Updated Outcome / Results

- Repository scan: No infrastructure-as-code or config files in this repo define or reference AWS Elastic IPs (EIPs); the only occurrences are in this question summary itself.
- Interpretation: Any Elastic IPs you see for this project are likely managed outside this codebase (e.g., manually in AWS console, in another infra repository, or via separate tooling).
- Limitation: Without direct access to your AWS account/resources, it's not possible to authoritatively mark specific EIPs as unused or safe to release, but we can define a verification procedure.
- Next steps: Provide you with a concrete checklist/commands to verify which EIPs are in use and whether any can be released.
