Context: Obsidian LaTeX PDF plugin in repo obsidian-latex-pdf; user exports note ~/obsidian/projects/1. projects/Sagro/Sagrosoft 2.0/self-billing.md with the Report template and Pandoc command fails with LaTeX error "Environment callout-info undefined". This happens after user patched repo, built, committed, pushed, created a release, and updated plugin in Obsidian via BRAT.

Actual question: Diagnose and fix the LaTeX environment error so that callouts in the note export correctly to PDF using the report template, then create and publish a new plugin release so Obsidian (via BRAT) can pick up the fix.

What is unclear: Exact plugin version and existing releases on GitHub; whether other templates are affected; whether note contains specific callout types beyond [!info]. These can be inferred or validated by running the same Pandoc command after making code changes.

Improving desired results: Ensure callout environments defined in templates/common/callouts.tex match those emitted by the TypeScript transformCallouts() helper in src/pandocRunner.ts; add tests and/or a sample note to guard against regressions; run lint/build/tests before release.

Outcome: Resolved – first, updated templates/report/template.tex to add Pandoc-compatible helpers (tightlist, real, longtable/booktabs, array/calc, and dummy counter), verified that templates/common/callouts.tex defines LaTeX environments like callout-info correctly via a standalone XeLaTeX test, and successfully exported the self-billing.md note to PDF via direct Pandoc invocation using the Report template and callouts preamble. Then discovered that with the Article template Pandoc’s --include-in-header was not injected because the custom templates lacked a $header-includes$ block, so callouts.tex was never loaded and callout-info remained undefined. Fixed this by wiring a $for(header-includes)$ $header-includes$ $endfor$ block into all LaTeX templates (article, report, kaobook), regenerated a minimal article callout test and validated it compiles with XeLaTeX, re-ran Pandoc on self-billing.md with the Article template successfully, reran npm build/test, bumped plugin from 0.1.28 to 0.1.29, committed/pushed, and created GitHub release v0.1.29 so BRAT can pick up both report and article callout fixes.
