Context:
User is working on the obsidian-latex-pdf project to generate PDFs from Obsidian notes with LaTeX/Pandoc templates.

Question:
"Let's turn things around. Could you analyse each template and make a list of all mandatory information and create a proposal how to name the frontmatter field and which type to address. We should document the list with mandatory frontmatter and their type per template for easy reference. We could even go so far to add this list to the repostory for easy maintenance which is used to create our checks and serverity in obsidion."

Analysis:
- Context: Project contains one or more templates (likely LaTeX/Pandoc) used to generate PDFs from Obsidian notes.
- Actual question: Ask the assistant to inspect all templates in the repo, infer which pieces of information are mandatory for each template, propose concrete frontmatter field names and types, and document this per template, potentially as a repository-maintained source of truth for validation and severity checks.
- Unclear / needs attention:
  - Exact location and format of the templates (e.g. .tex, .yaml, .md, or config files).
  - Whether some required information is implied by business rules rather than strictly required by the LaTeX template (e.g. document type, project id).
  - Desired file format and location for the canonical frontmatter schema (JSON/YAML/TS/MD).
- What we can do to improve results:
  - Discover all template files in the repository and inspect their placeholders/variables.
  - For each template, list the semantic information it needs (title, author, date, etc.).
  - Propose consistent frontmatter field names and basic types (string, date, enum, boolean, list).
  - Propose a central schema file format that can be consumed by Obsidian validation logic.

Outcomes / results so far:
- No analysis of templates done yet.
- Next step: scan repo for template files, read them, and derive a per-template mandatory frontmatter specification plus a proposal for a schema representation.
