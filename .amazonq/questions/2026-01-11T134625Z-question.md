Context:
User is working on the obsidian-latex-pdf project to generate PDFs from Obsidian notes with LaTeX/Pandoc templates.

Question:
"We should let the configuration depict the serverity per field now we have this in place. Please implement including the helper"

Analysis:
- Context: We have already analysed all LaTeX templates and identified candidate frontmatter fields and severities per template.
- Actual question: Implement a configuration-driven schema where, for each template, each frontmatter field has an associated severity, and create a helper in the plugin code that reads this configuration and validates a note's frontmatter.
- Unclear / needs attention:
  - Preferred config format and location (e.g. JSON or YAML file in repo root or under `config/`).
  - How the helper should surface validation results to the UI (Obsidian modal, status panel, or just a structured return value used elsewhere).
- What we can do to improve results:
  - Add a single canonical config file describing templates, fields, types, and severities.
  - Implement a TypeScript helper that takes: (templateId, frontmatter) and returns a list of issues with severities and messages.
  - Integrate the helper into the existing export flow to block generation on error-level issues.

Outcomes / results so far:
- Design for schema and severities is drafted conceptually but not yet implemented in code.
- Next step: create the config file and helper, then wire validation into the export path.
