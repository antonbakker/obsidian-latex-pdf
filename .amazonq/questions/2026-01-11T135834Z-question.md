Context:
User wants the obsidian-latex-pdf plugin to be "fools proof", only allowing export when the likelihood of success is very high.

Question:
"We need to make the plugin fools proof meaning it should only allow exporting to pdf when the likelyhood off success is very high."

Analysis:
- Context: We already have a schema-driven validator that marks issues as error/warning and a PrintModal that shows validation results but still allows export even when errors exist.
- Actual question: Tighten behaviour so that PDF export is blocked whenever validation indicates likely failure (i.e., when there are error-level issues).
- Unclear / needs attention:
  - Whether user wants a hard block or an optional override (confirmation) in edge cases.
  - Whether additional heuristics beyond frontmatter validation are desired (e.g., template availability checks, engine availability).
- What we can do to improve results:
  - Enforce that Export is disabled in the UI when validation.isValid === false.
  - Add a defensive check in the export callback to bail out if validation contains errors.
  - Keep warnings non-blocking, but clearly visible.

Outcomes / results so far:
- Validator and schema are implemented and used to compute ValidationResult.
- Next step: gate the export action on ValidationResult.isValid, both in the modal UI and in the export callback.
