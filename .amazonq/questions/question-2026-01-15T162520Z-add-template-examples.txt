Question context:
- Task: add comprehensive example notes for the newly added templates (IEEE proposal, business plan, KOMA-Script proposal) for reference and demonstration.

Question analysis:
- Context: Obsidian LaTeX PDF plugin already has example notes for other templates under examples/.
- Actual question: Create rich, realistic markdown notes that showcase recommended frontmatter and section structure for each of the three new templates.
- Relation to previous question: Direct continuation of the earlier task where the templates and validation schemas were added and released as v0.1.34.
- Unclear aspects:
  - Exact naming convention for new example files (assume <template-id>-example.md under examples/).
  - Whether _pandoc versions are also needed (likely not strictly required for now).
- Plan:
  - Inspect existing example notes to mirror structure and explanatory comments.
  - Add three new example notes under examples/ with comprehensive frontmatter and section headings.

Status:
- Analysis logged; implementation of example notes not started yet.
