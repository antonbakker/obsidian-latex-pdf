Context:
User is working on obsidian-latex-pdf plugin; frontmatter and environment validation are in place.

Question:
"it's fine to add the details section"

Analysis:
- Context: We've tightened validation and the user approved adding a details/documentation section that explains required frontmatter and checks per template.
- Actual question: Proceed to add a documentation section (likely in README or similar) summarising validation rules so end-users understand why exports may be blocked.
- Unclear / needs attention:
  - Preferred target file for documentation (README.md vs separate docs file). README.md is the most natural default.
- What we can do to improve results:
  - Update README.md with a concise section describing per-template required frontmatter and environment checks, aligned with frontmatterSchema.ts and environment.ts.

Outcomes / results so far:
- Implementation is done; only documentation remains to make behaviour discoverable.
