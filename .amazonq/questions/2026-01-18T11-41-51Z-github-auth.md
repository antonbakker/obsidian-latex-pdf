# Question Analysis

- **Context**: User is working in a Git-tracked project and attempted to authenticate the GitHub CLI using `echo GHCR_ADMIN_TOKEN | gh auth login --with-token`, which failed with `HTTP 401: Bad credentials`.
- **Actual Question**: How to correctly log in to GitHub using a token with `gh auth login`.
- **Unclear / Needs Attention**:
  - Whether `GHCR_ADMIN_TOKEN` is currently stored as an environment variable or only known as a literal value.
  - Whether the token has the correct scopes for the intended operations (e.g. repo, packages).
- **Improvement Opportunities**:
  - Use environment variables instead of echoing raw secrets.
  - Ensure the token is created with appropriate scopes for GitHub CLI and/or GHCR.

# Outcome / Result

- Explained why `echo GHCR_ADMIN_TOKEN | gh auth login --with-token` fails (it passes the literal string `GHCR_ADMIN_TOKEN` instead of the token value).
- Provided a secure pattern using an environment variable and piping its value into `gh auth login --with-token`.
- Mentioned that HTTP 401 can also indicate an invalid/expired token or missing scopes, which the user should verify in GitHub.
- No further blocking issues identified; next step is for the user to re-run authentication using the corrected command and a valid token.
