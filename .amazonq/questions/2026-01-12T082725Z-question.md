Context:
User is using the obsidian-latex-pdf plugin. Notes often omit a level-1 heading in Obsidian because the note title already resembles the chapter name.

Request:
"In obsidian you often don't insert a level 1 header since this would be double since the note title / name already resenmbles the chapter name. Could you update our plugin to use the note title / name when the the first header in the note is level two or higher ( 3, ...). Thus when the first heading is not a level one ( # ) use the note title / name as the first heading and insert this."

Analysis:
- Context: Export pipeline currently reads the note content and passes it directly to pandoc. Validation is already in place for frontmatter but not for heading structure.
- Actual task: Modify the preprocessing step so that, if the first markdown heading in the note body is not an H1 (#), automatically insert an H1 at the top using the note's filename as the heading text.
- Important details:
  - Must respect YAML frontmatter at the top (insert heading after frontmatter, not before).
  - If the first heading is already level 1, do nothing.
  - If there is no heading at all, we likely should still insert an H1 with the note title so pandoc/LaTeX have a top-level section.
- Implementation idea:
  - Add a pure helper (e.g. injectNoteTitleHeadingIfMissing(content, noteTitle)) in pandocRunner.ts.
  - Use it in preprocessNoteToTempFile before writing the temp file.
  - Add unit tests to cover cases: with/without frontmatter; first heading H1 vs H2+ vs no heading.

Outcomes / results so far:
- No code changes yet; next step is to modify src/pandocRunner.ts and add tests.
