Context:
User is defining requirements for validating frontmatter before generating a PDF in the obsidian-latex-pdf project.

Question:
"We need to check all required frontmatter is present and present a list and categorise any shortcommings by priority ( e.g. error, warning etc. ) and clearly state what is needed before being able to generate the pdf. Does this answer your question?"

Analysis:
- Context: Obsidian notes are converted to PDF; frontmatter must meet certain requirements first.
- Actual question: Whether this requirement description sufficiently answers a prior clarification request about expected validation behavior.
- Unclear / needs attention:
  - Exact list of required frontmatter fields.
  - Which missing/invalid fields are blocking (errors) vs non-blocking (warnings).
  - Desired format/location of the validation report (CLI output, log, or in-app message).
- What we can do to improve results:
  - Define a concrete schema for required and optional frontmatter keys.
  - Implement a validator that returns a structured list of issues categorised by severity.
  - Enforce that PDF generation is only allowed when there are no error-level issues.

Outcomes / results so far:
- Clarified that we must:
  - Check that all required frontmatter fields are present.
  - Report all issues grouped by priority (e.g. error, warning).
  - Clearly state which missing items block PDF generation.
- Implementation not yet done; pending concrete schema and integration details.
